  ::- unary operator that allows: constants, instance methods and class methods defined within a class or module, to be accessed from anywhere outside the class or module.

  <=>Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.
  == Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
  ===Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.
  != not equal
  =~ nearly equal (ignores floats)
  !~ not nearly equal (ignores floats
  && logical AND
  || logical OR
